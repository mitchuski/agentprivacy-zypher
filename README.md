## Overview

The **Proof of Proverb Revelation Protocol** is the first concrete implementation of the [0xagentprivacy](https://agentprivacy.ai) dual-agent architecture. It demonstrates privacy-preserving AI verification through a novel proof-of-understanding protocol on Zcash.

**What It Does**: First Persons (humans) prove comprehension of privacy concepts by forming proverbs. These proverbs are verified by AI (without seeing transaction data), then inscribed on-chain as immutable proof of understanding—creating Verifiable Relationship Credentials (VRCs) through demonstrated comprehension rather than surveillance.

**Why It Matters**: This is infrastructure for the relationship economy where trust comes from understanding, not data extraction.

```

**0xagentprivacy** solves the privacy-delegation paradox: AI agents need information to act on your behalf, but that same information enables surveillance. The solution is **dual-agent architecture**—splitting observation rights (Swordsman) from action capabilities (Mage) with mathematical separation guarantees.

This hackathon implementation proves the architecture works:
- ✅ Cryptographic separation of viewing/spending keys
- ✅ Privacy-preserving AI verification
- ✅ On-chain proof inscriptions
- ✅ VRC formation through RPP compression

## The Dual-Agent Model

               Separation preserves sovereignty
```

**Mathematical Guarantee** [Research Paper v3.2]:
- `I(X; Y_S, Y_M) = I(X; Y_S) + I(X; Y_M)` — Information leakage is additive, not multiplicative
- `R_max < 1` — Perfect reconstruction is impossible
- The gap between agents preserves human dignity

## How It Works

### The Signal Flow

```
First Person reads Spellbook
         │
         ▼
    Forms proverb (RPP compression)
    Using own model/context for uniqueness
         │
         ▼
    Sends shielded z→z transaction
    Memo: [rpp-v1][act-id][timestamp][proverb]
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            ORACLE (Swordsman)           │
│                                         │
│  1. Viewing key decrypts memo           │
│  2. Fetches canonical proverb (IPFS)    │
│  3. AI verifies semantic match          │
│     (AI NEVER sees amounts/addresses)   │
│  4. Calculates golden split (61.8/38.2) │
│  5. Inscribes proof on-chain            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

### Terminology [Glossary v2.1]

| Term | Meaning | In This Implementation |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| **Signal** | 0.01 ZEC ongoing proof of comprehension | Proverb submission fee |
| **Ceremony** | 1 ZEC one-time agent pair genesis | Not implemented (future) |
| **First Person** | Human whose sovereignty is protected | The person forming proverbs |
| **VRC** | Verifiable Relationship Credential | On-chain inscription proof |
| **RPP** | Relationship Proverb Protocol | Compression through proverbs |

---

## Current Status

### ✅ Complete

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 16 with story reader, Mage chat, signal flow |
| **Backend** | Oracle with transaction monitoring, AI verification |
| **Blockchain** | Zebra + Zallet integration, inscription system |
| **AI Verification** | NEAR Cloud AI (privacy-preserving) |

## Privacy Guarantees

### Information Bounds

```
I(Soulbae; Transaction_Amount) = 0
I(Soulbae; First_Person_Identity) = 0  
I(Soulbae; Wallet_Address) = 0
I(Soulbae; Transaction_Timing) = 0
```

**Soulbae (Mage) only processes**: Tale principle → Understanding → Proverb suggestion

### What's Public vs Private

| Public (by design) | Private (guaranteed) |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Story content | Signal amounts |
| Inscribed proverbs | Wallet addresses |
| VRC existence | First Person identity |
| TEE attestation | Transaction timing |

---

## Economic Model [Tokenomics v2.0]

### Signal Fee: 0.01 ZEC

Every signal (proverb submission) follows the golden ratio split:

```
Signal (0.01 ZEC)
├── 61.8% → Transparent Pool
│   └── On-chain inscription (public proof)
│
└── 38.2% → Shielded Pool
    └── Protocol operations (private)
```

**Why Golden Ratio**: φ ≈ 1.618 emerges as conjectured optimal balance between privacy protection and delegation capability. The 61.8/38.2 split creates natural equilibrium.

### Trust Tier Progression [Tokenomics v2.0, §5]

| Tier | Signals | Capabilities |
|------|---------|--------------|
| 🗡️ **Blade** | 0-50 | Basic participation |
| 🛡️ **Light** | 50-150 | Multi-site coordination |
| ⚔️ **Heavy** | 150-500 | Template creation |
| 🐉 **Dragon** | 500+ | Guardian eligibility |

*Note: Tier tracking not yet implemented in this version.*

## The Vision

We're not building a donation button. We're building **infrastructure for the relationship economy**.

Where:
- Trust comes from understanding, not surveillance
- Relationships are bilateral, not mediated by platforms
- Reputation is earned through comprehension
- Privacy is preserved by architecture, not policy
- AI agents extend sovereignty without surrendering it

**This is the foundation for privacy-preserving AI agents.**
